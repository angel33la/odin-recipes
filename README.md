This is a project that I built with html/css for The Odin project. It is a simple website with a few recipes on it. I have kept this nice and clean and very simple.

## motivation 
The motivation behind this project is to start my web development journey. I have read a lot of reviews about how the Odin Project is the best free course online. I wanted to decide to go through and learn the basics in the best way possible. I hope that you will find my website to be just as good as those before me. I plan to make my way through learning web development and become a web developer that I can one day get employment with. 

### installation 
There is not anything hard or complicated about odin-recipes. It is very basic HTML and CSS.
